# Take screenshot
# Chunk screenshot into x amount of sections
# Create a grid overlayed against each chunked screenshot with x,y labels based off the total resolution of the original screenshot, use as large of a font size for the labels as possible
# Save a copy of and provide a link to the model with each of the chunked screenshots
# After the model returns a x,y tuple, feed the x,y tuple with the original prompt back into gpt3.5-turbo with an expected one-line response of the pyautogui code to be run to complete the users action:
